# express-api-project
This project involves creating a Node.js application using the Express framework to build a RESTful API. The API retrieves data from a JSON file and serves it through various endpoints which enables easy access and interaction with the data.

Objectives
1) Develop a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.
2) Learn how to handle JSON data efficiently in a backend application.
3) Implement key HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing data.

I learned how to set up and configure an Express application in Node.js, reading and writing JSON data dynamically.
Designing RESTful APIs with well-defined routes and endpoints
